/**
 * Factory class for creating {@link ValidationUI} instances that can decorate
 * a Swing GUI-component when it has a Problem.
 *
 * <p> By default, one instance of a class implementing this interface
 * is used to create a
 * ValidationUI for all components handled by the simplevalidation
 * framework. This instance can be replaced with a custom one, as
 * described below.  
 * <p>
 * For custom decoration, simply pass a different
 * decorator factory in ValidationGroup.add() (and if necessary, proxy the
 * default decorator factory for all but some specific kind of component).
 * 
 * A rudimentary example of writing a component decorator:  The code and
 * description below show how to replace the default
 * SwingComponentDecorationFactory with one that will create {@code ValidationUI}
 * instances that draws a thick colored border around the component
 * when there is an error.
 * <p>
 *<blockquote><pre>{@code
 * package com.foo.myapp;
 * public class MySwingComponentDecorationFactory extends SwingComponentDecorationFactory {
 *      public ValidationUI decorationFor(final JComponent c) {
 *         return new ValidationUI() {
 *             private javax.swing.border.Border origBorder = c.getBorder();
 *             public void showProblem(Problem problem) {
 *                if( problem == null ) {
 *                    c.setBorder(origBorder);
 *                } else {
 *                    c.setBorder(javax.swing.BorderFactory.createLineBorder(problem.severity().color(), 3));
 *                }
 *             }
 *        };
 *     }
 *  };
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 * 
 * Our <code>MySwingComponentDecorationFactory</code> is then registered so that
 * it can be found using JDK 6's <code>ServiceLoader</code> (or NetBeans'
 * <code>Lookup</code>):  Create a file named <code>org.netbeans.validation.api.ui.swing.SwingComponentDecorationFactory</code>
 * in the folder <code>META-INF/services</code> in your source root (so that
 * it will be included in the JAR file).  Add one line of text to this file -
 * the fully qualified name of your class, e.g.
 * <pre>
 * com.foo.myapp.MySwingComponentDecorationFactory
 * </pre>
